A lot of People know me as Kanyasya, Kanyas, Grace, among many other name inventions that relate to my identity.
 However, my proper complete name is Grace Mwende Kanyasya. A girl whose loves music, especially the type that speaks to
  my soul. I love seeing people happy and at peace. I love everything about good hair, and I keep a lot of designer 
  friends because they are very interesting people, whose level of creativity intrigues me. </p>
  <p >I enjoy fierce business 
  and financial conversations. I love adventure, events and social connections.  I love listening to different 
  perspectives and mentalities on different things. I like to eat, pizza being my favorite (utterly not the reason
   I named this blog Pizzes, something you’d actually know if you checked out; About Pizzes). Chicken for me comes 
   right after pizza, so if you were to add one to two, you’d figure out that Chicken barbeque is my pizza jam.</p>

    I appreciate anyone and anything that challenges my thinking, beliefs, and ideologies. I love solving problems,
     issues. I enjoy real in-depth conversations, and cheers to all paragraph texters, same Whatsapp group guys!
